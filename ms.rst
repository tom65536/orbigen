Mass, Temperature and Luminosity Relations
------------------------------------------

Using the relations for main sequence stars given
in :cite:`Brown_2015` we can relate mass, luminosity
and temperature. Strictly speaking the relation may
not be exact for the full range of values, but it is
precise enough for our (non-scientific) purposes.

.. math::

        \frac{T}{T_0}=\left(\frac{L}{L_0}\right)^{0.12}=\left(\frac{M}{M_0}\right)^{0.12\cdot3.5}=\left(\frac{M}{M_0}\right)^{0.42}
